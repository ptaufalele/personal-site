            <h1>General Advice</h1>
            <p>First step --> relax. Grants and fellowship applications can seem daunting but they can also be an enriching experience. If you 
                at all are considering the academic life, than writing is going to be a good portion of your job experience. Writing itself 
                is a super valuable skill that is translatable to almost any job/situation. Furthermore, it gives you some time to break up 
                the somewhat mundane work in research with some intellectually stimulating work that requires some creative brain work (not saying that the 
                rest of research doesn't, but sometimes culturing cells gets old). I have also found that writing a personal statment makes you really think 
                about life..
            </p>
            <p>Formatting... I have had an application automatically rejected for a formatting error. Don't make this mistake. Plz.</p>
            <p>Examples: Ask your lab mates and class mates and anyone you can for examples. Winning examples are even better. I recommend reading 
                each one prior to starting or while you are beginning. But once you start writing seriously, I usually try to stay away from reading 
                any other examples to make sure I don't risk copying there writing. After I finish writing a draft, I will go back to other examples to 
                make sure I'm not missing out on anything (also look at the instructions).
            </p>
            <p>If you are experiencing writers block. Try typing your thoughs (they are usually incomplete and fragments) and try to explain what you want to put 
                into the section you are on. I write as if I am talking with a friend/lab mate and throw whatever I can down on paper. Then after there are some actual words 
                on the paper, I try to start forming sentences and work off these until the creative juices start flowing again. Also a change of scenery can be good.
                I usually like writing in the library away from my desk and my home so that I can get some focus (maybe hard during covid). Another method I have tried 
                is to rewrite things you already have. For example, if you are halfway down the page and can't write any further, you might try to rewrite the first few paragraphs 
                and see if that helps you get further down the page. Lastly, try not to burn out. If you have a short deadline than there may not be a choice. But it 
                sometimes feels that you can write yourself dry. Usually I will try to stop a little bit short of where I think I'm running out of juice. The hardest part 
                of writing is getting started, so if you can stay in that frame of mind through multiple days/weeks, you will likely be more productive and may escape writers block.
            </p>
            <p>If you want anyone to read over your application or want any of my previous applications for reference, feel free to email me or reach me some way.</p>
